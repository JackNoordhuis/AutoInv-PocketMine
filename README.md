## About
AutoInv is a [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) plugin that aims to reduce the amount of lag caused
by item entities on your server. This is achieved by adding items directly to players' inventories when they break a block,
kill another player or are near an explosion. All of these options are easily configurable in the [Settings](https://github.com/JackNoordhuis/AutoInv/blob/master/resources/Settings.yml)
file that is automatically generated by the plugin when it is first installed. By default, AutoInv will only add items directly
to players inventories when they break blocks (explosion and death drops can be enabled in the config too.)

## Installation
1. Go to the [Release Page](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/AutoInv) and download a `.phar` file from there.
2. Copy the downloaded `.phar` to the `plugins` folder in your server folder.
3. Now simply start/restart the server and the plugin should be working.

## Experimental Builds
You can grab the latest development `.phar` builds of AutoInv over on [poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/JackNoordhuis/AutoInv-PocketMine/AutoInv)!
