### About

AutoInv is a [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) plugin that aims to reduce the amount of lag caused by item entities on your server. This is achieved by adding items directly to players' inventories when they break a block, kill another player or are near an explosion. All of these options are easily configurable in the [Settings](https://github.com/JackNoordhuis/AutoInv/blob/master/resources/Settings.yml) file that is automatically generated by the plugin when it is first installed, by default AutoInv will only add items directly to players inventories when they break blocks (explosion and death drops can be enabled in the config too).
